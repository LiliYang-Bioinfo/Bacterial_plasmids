## Host range and prevalence
#### 1. Host range 
+ Getting taxonomic information of isolates according to their assembly ID -- 01.get_taxomic_ID.py
+ Getting detailed taxonomy description of isolates from their taxonomic ID. --Taxonkit 
+ Combining other information about the isolates 
> 01.host\_am\_info: the information about isolates from American\_am
> 01.host\_info: the information about all isolates
#### 2. Prevalence
+ The metagenome samples -- 02.metagenome_samples.xlsx
+ The existence of PLCs in different samples and the host range inferred from isolates -- 03.prevalence.xlsx
